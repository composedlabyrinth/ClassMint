## Vision

ClassMint aims to revolutionize classroom engagement by incentivizing student participation through blockchain technology. By issuing tokens for active participation, ClassMint fosters a more interactive and rewarding learning experience, empowering both teachers and students to achieve greater educational outcomes.

## How It Works

1. Teacher Authorization:
   - Only authorized teachers can distribute tokens to students.

2. Rewarding Participation:
   - Teachers use the ClassMint platform to send tokens to students based on their participation in class.

3. Token Transfers:
   - Students can transfer tokens among themselves as a form of peer recognition or trading.

4. Balance Inquiry:
   - Both students and teachers can check their token balances through the platform.
